This is the raw source for my slide decks:

Both slide decks use S5 [1] which allow you to
create slide decks and handouts and a reasonable
printed form using stylesheets and pretty simple
html. I recommend it.

The interesting thing I have done here is to integrate
the shjs [2] source code pretty printer into the mix. And also
to add my own little source code extraction tool in python
which snips code out of the source code material and puts
it into a new html file appropriately quoted.

I didn't have to say "Hmm, my powerpoint compiler isn't
working today" even once!

A cleverer (and more javascript savvy) person would have managed to
do the code extraction directly in javascript, probably using the file
apis [3] - I look forward to seeing any attempts!
